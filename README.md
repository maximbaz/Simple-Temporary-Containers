# Simple Temporary Containers

Create temporary containers with one click.  Temporary containers are removed
when their last tab is closed.

Create temporary containers in any of three ways:
* By clicking the extension's icon in the navigation bar.
* By pressing Ctrl+Alt+C.
* By right-clicking on a link and selecting "Open Link in New Temp Container Tab".

To keep a temporary container indefinitely, change its name (e.g. using Preferences -> Tabs -> Settings or Firefox Multi-Account Containers).

Requires minimal permissions:
* "contextualIdentities": Required in order to create and remove containers.
* "cookies": Required in order to open tabs in containers, and to notice when a temporary container is empty.
* "menus": Required to add the "Open Link in New Temp Container Tab" menu item.
